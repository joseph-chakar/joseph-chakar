### Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Joseph Chakar, and I'm a PhD student applying machine learning (ML) techniques to the field of solar energy.

Specifically, I am combining ML, modeling, and experimentation to better understand the relationship between device parameters and solar cell performance and stability. I'm also developing practical tools to analyze the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems, and I spend time testing the stability of promising cell technologies under real conditions, among other things.

On this page, you'll find:
- ‚ÄúHomemade‚Äù codes and tutorials on how to use Bayesian inference and classical machine learning techniques for scientific applications (solar energy research in this case) 
- Links to my latest open-access publication _Determining Solar Cell Parameters and Degradation Rates from Power Production_ Data and PV power generation dataset
- A curated list of online resources that have helped me learn about ML and solar energy 

It‚Äôs still a work in progress with a lot of room for improvement, so I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have.

Considering that I have a background in mechanical engineering, I wouldn't have been able to learn about ML or how to apply it to the field of PV if it weren‚Äôt for the incredible scientists and researchers who have published their work and provided free online resources to share and explain what they do. This page is thus my way of giving back to the community and promoting open-access research. 

If you wish to reach out, let's connect on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephchakar) and/or exchange emails (josephchakar8@gmail.com). I'd love to tell you more about my projects and learn about yours!
