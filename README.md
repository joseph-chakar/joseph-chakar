### Hi there üëã

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Joseph Chakar, and I'm a PhD student applying machine learning (ML) techniques to the field of solar energy.

I combine ML, modeling, and experimentation to study degradation at the solar cell, panel, and systems levels. Specifically, I am developing a set of Bayesian inference (and optimization) tools and showcasing their effectiveness in a variety of real-life (photovoltaic) applications.

In short, my repos consist of:
- ‚ÄúHomemade‚Äù tutorials and codes on how to use Bayesian inference and classical machine learning techniques for scientific applications (solar energy research in this case) 
- Links to my latest open-access publications and PV power generation dataset
- A curated list of online resources that have helped me learn about ML and solar energy 

Considering that I have a background in mechanical engineering, I wouldn't have been able to learn about ML or how to apply it to the field of PV if it weren‚Äôt for the incredible scientists and researchers who have published their work and provided free online resources to share and explain what they do. This page is thus my way of giving back to the community and promoting open-access research. 

It's still a work in progress with a lot of room for improvement, so I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have.

If you wish to reach out or even collaborate, let's connect on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephchakar) and/or exchange emails (josephchakar8@gmail.com). I'd love to tell you more about my projects and learn about yours!
