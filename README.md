### Hi there üëã

I'm a PhD student applying machine learning (ML) techniques to the field of solar energy.

Considering that I have a background in mechanical engineering, I wouldn't have been able to learn about ML or how to apply it to the field of photovoltaics (PV) if it weren‚Äôt for the incredible scientists and researchers who have published their work and provided free online resources to share and explain what they do. This page is thus my way of giving back to the community and promoting open-access research.

My repos consist of:
- ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù codes and tutorials on how to apply Bayesian inference and classical machine learning techniques for scientific research (PV research in my case) 
- links to my latest open-access publication Determining Solar Cell Parameters and Degradation Rates from Power Production Data and photovoltaic (PV) power generation dataset
- a curated list of online resources that have helped me learn about ML and solar energy 

It‚Äôs still a work in progress with a lot of room for improvement, so I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback or suggestions you might have. 

I'm also interested in collaborating with researchers who share similar interests. I'd be happy to tell you more about my ongoing projects and learn about yours.
